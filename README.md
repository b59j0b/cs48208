Suggestions 
Task: 
o Read the Core Task Requirements on Page 1 and Essay Format on Page 3 when planning this task.
o Is your one clear negative effect of globalization related to a logical theme? Logical themes include but are not limited to the economy, the environment, or society.
- Consider your expertise and interest when considering a potential negative effect of globalization.
o Organise your ideas clearly and logically. Plan carefully before attempting to write your essay.
o Consider how the Introduction and Problem sections should tackle different aspects of this issue.
o How should the Solution and Evaluation sections tackle different aspects of the solution?
o What ‘additional general background information’ could feature in the Introduction?
- Possibilities include a definition, historical context, recent trends etc.
o Consider the difference between the Solution and Evaluation sections.
o How should the Solution and Evaluation sections tackle different aspects of the solution?
o Find and analyse several academic sources relating to the topic. Cite these sources to support your main ideas with details, reasons, explanations, data, or examples throughout your essay.
o Consider carefully how data, figures, or statistics could be used to support and develop your idea.
o When citing a visual aid such as a data set, infographic, table, chart, or graph then you must paste this into your essay. You should include this after the relevant section where it is cited such as the Introduction, but before the sub-heading for the following section.
o You must paraphrase, summarise or synthesize ideas and data you use from sources.
o a Source Integration Chart must also be provided to include this information.
o for instance, focus on the relevant sections of the data and explain the important trends, rather than listing all the numbers or simply repeating them.
o Include a range of integration techniques including integral and non-integral citations. Similarly, when using integral citations ensure that you utilize a range of appropriate and accurate reporting verbs.
o Informal sources such as Wikipedia, UKEssays.com, Scribbr or Baidu, and sources not originally produced in English will reduce the essay quality and cause issues in Task. If you are unsure about the appropriateness of a source, please refer to items highlighted in EAP115 such as the CRAAP Test or SCAPR tests in Semester 1, Week 1. If you are still unsure after attempting to analyse the source, consider checking this with your EAP115 lecturer.
Organisation: 
o Consistency and connections should be achieved throughout your essay from cohesion between the introduction, sections of the essay, and the conclusion by including:
o an identifiable thesis statement at the very end of the introduction which should indicate the focus and structure of your essay.
o clear topic sentences for each section of the essay should highlight the specific focus of that section. A citation will not be accepted as an appropriate topic sentence.
o a restated thesis statement at the beginning of the conclusion which should align with your thesis statement.
Language: 
o Consider how to use topic-specific vocabulary and how to reduce repetition.
o Use a range of linking words (e.g. ‘In addition, For instance, However, Firstly’).
o Follow the academic register in terms of lexical choices and grammatical structures.
o Follow academic writing style. guidelines introduced in Year 1 EAP.
o Proofread carefully to avoid causing issues for the reader.
General: 
o Refer back to relevant feedback from Year 1 EAP and EAP115 on your academic writing. Try to correct any issues that you are already aware of. This is good practice to ensure that your EAP115 lecturer does not highlight the same issues in feedback resulting in less efficient feedback.
- This includes global FWCW feedback and the FWCW assessment report.
o After submitting your essay, check to see that it has been uploaded properly by downloading your document again and opening it.
o Refer to the Project WCW marking descriptor on Page 6 of this task sheet and the assessment area on EAP115’s LMC page to understand what is required for a better-quality essay.
